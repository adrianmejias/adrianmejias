- 🔭 I'm currently working on random applications built w/ `Laravel`, `JetStream`, `TailwindCSS`, `AlpineJS`, and `NativePHP`.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on a framework for the [FiveM GTA API](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/).

- 📺 I watch `GTA RP` (mostly Chang Gang).
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on any type of `PHP` driven project.
- 🤔 I'm searching for mentorship in a `leadership role` or `entrepreneurship`.
- 🖥️ I'd like to get into streaming coding or gaming on [Twitch](https://bit.ly/abstract-coding-twitch).
- 💬 Ask me about: How I got to where I am today as a `self taught` developer.
- 📫 How to reach me: Direct to google hangouts, email, discord, or twitter would be best to reach me.
